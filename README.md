# About
The trajectory of this project is to analyze the data and identify any possible patterns. In addition, to constructing a predictive value in Total Products Sold for comparison among the global market. Based on the comparison, I executed the finding of the root mean squared errors to determine any errors in the predictive model.

# Final Report 
The MSE models for out and in sample data are identical and farther from 0. Futhermore, this reveals a more precarious outcome concerning the data for any futher projections. As both MSEs result in 43.29, I am uncertain of the latter results due to the base objective for the model construction.
